# Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Guide App

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

This project is a completion guide for some of the key elements in the game Xenoblade Chronicles 2. The application will provide guidance on finding and/or unlocking elements such as:

* Blades
* Blade skills
* Driver skills
* Quests
* Heart 2 hearts
* Named monsters

The project also gives users the abilty to avoid spoilers in the game as there will be a way to hide elements which are unavailable to the user based on their progress in the story and already obtained data.

Finally, the application will also allow the users to track the exact number of things unlocked and collected, all in one place to give a quick view of collection progress.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This script also runs the server, which is also made in the project. While having server and client side of the application is not necessarily the best practice, in this instance, the server side is very simple and small.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Other create-react-app scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
